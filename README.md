# Problem
To work with an API.

# Working and Result
Python and its libraries was used to fetch data from the application programming interface, display wanted and specific data, ask questions and answer them.  
2 files were created, one csv and another excel file to visualise the data that the api contains.

**Conclusion**
The aim of this project was to improve how we work with json data obtained from API'S which was successful.
